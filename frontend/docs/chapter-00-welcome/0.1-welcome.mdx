# Lesson 0.1: The Goal

Welcome, future Robot Engineer. 👋

You are about to start a journey that will take you from "knowing nothing about robots" to "controlling a simulated humanoid robot with Artificial Intelligence."

## What You Are Building
By the end of this book, you will have built a **Physical AI**—a brain for a robot that learns to move by itself. You won't just write strict rules like "move leg 10 degrees." You will create a learning system that figures out *how* to move, just like a human baby learns to walk.

We will use:
- **Python**: The language of AI.
- **MuJoCo**: A professional physics simulator (so you don't need to buy a $50,000 robot yet).
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The AI technique behind ChatGPT, AlphaGo, and modern robotics.

## Who This Book Is For
You do **not** need a PhD. You do **not** need to be a math genius.
You just need:
1.  **Curiosity**: A desire to know how things work.
2.  **Persistence**: Robots (even simulated ones) can be frustrating. They fall over. A lot.
3.  **A Computer**: Any basic Mac, Windows, or Linux machine will do.

## How to Read This Book
This is a **"Concrete Sandwich"** book.
1.  **The Hook**: We start with a cool result or problem.
2.  **The Intuition**: We explain *why* it works using simple analogies (no math yet!).
3.  **The Code**: We write real, running code.
4.  **The Math**: We sneak in the formal equations *after* you understand the intuition.

## Let's Begin
If you are ready to build the future, turn the page. We have some tools to set up first.
