# Lesson 0.2: The Toolbox (Prerequisites)

Before we start the engines, we need to open our toolbox. Robotics requires three main tools. Let's make sure you have them.

---

## 1. Python (The Language)

Robots speak Python. It is the standard language for AI and Machine Learning.
If you don't have Python installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**Check if you have it:**
Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) and type:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see something like `Python 3.10.x` or higher. If you see an error, please install Python first.

---

## 2. VS Code (The Editor)

You need a place to write code. We highly recommend **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**. It's free, popular, and great for Python.
Download it here: [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## 3. The Terminal (The Control Panel)

We will use the "Terminal" (or "Command Line") a lot. It makes you look like a hacker, but it's actually just a faster way to tell the computer what to do.

Here are the 3 commands you MUST know:

1.  **`ls`** (Mac/Linux) or **`dir`** (Windows): "List Files". Shows you what is in the current folder.
2.  **`cd <folder_name>`**: "Change Directory". Moves you into a folder.
    *   Example: `cd MyRobotProject`
    *   Tip: `cd ..` moves you *back* one folder.
3.  **`python <file_name.py>`**: Runs your python code.
    *   Example: `python hello_robot.py`

### Practice This Now!
1. Open your terminal.
2. Type `mkdir robot_practice` to make a new folder.
3. Type `cd robot_practice` to go into it.
4. Type `cd ..` to go back.

## 4. Virtual Environments (The Safety Bubble)

We will use something called a **Virtual Environment (venv)**.
Think of it like a "clean room" for your project. It prevents the libraries for this robot book from interfering with other Python projects on your computer.

We will create one in Chapter 1, but just know that it exists!

## Summary
*   [ ] Python installed?
*   [ ] Code Editor ready?
*   [ ] Know `ls`, `cd`, and `python`?

If you checked all three, you are ready for Chapter 1.
