# Implementation Plan: Introduction to Robotics & Physical AI

**Branch**: `001-intro-robotics` | **Date**: 2025-12-11 | **Spec**: [specs/001-intro-robotics/spec.md](specs/001-intro-robotics/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-intro-robotics/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation for the foundational "Introduction to Robotics" chapter. The feature will be delivered through a Docusaurus web frontend and include runnable Python code examples for simulation. The content will follow the newly adopted "Expanded Concrete Sandwich" pedagogical strategy (defined in FR-007 of the spec) to provide a more detailed, beginner-friendly learning experience.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+, TypeScript (for Docusaurus)
**Primary Dependencies**: `mujoco`, `numpy`, `pytest`, Docusaurus, React
**Storage**: N/A (Content files only)
**Testing**: `pytest` for validating Python code snippets.
**Target Platform**: Docusaurus (Web) + Local Python Environment
**Project Type**: Web application (content frontend) + Scripting (Python labs)
**Performance Goals**: Simulations must run smoothly on standard consumer CPUs.
**Constraints**: Content must adhere to the "Expanded Concrete Sandwich" structure.
**Scale/Scope**: 4 lessons for Chapter 1, each expanded with new sections (Analogy, Code Representation, Gotchas).

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **I. Academic Accuracy**: Verified. Sources are from 2022-2025.
- [x] **II. Robotics-First**: Verified. Uses real Unitree G1 hardware specs.
- [x] **III. Clarity and Reproducibility**: Verified. The new expanded structure enhances clarity.
- [x] **VI. AI-Native Pedagogy**: Verified. The structure supports personalization and agent augmentation.
- [x] **VII. Pedagogical Strategy**: Verified. The "Expanded Concrete Sandwich" is an evolution of the "Concrete Sandwich" principle.

```

**Structure Decision**: The project uses a hybrid structure. A `frontend` directory contains the Docusaurus application, which serves the `.mdx` content files. The Python code, while used by the content, has its tests in a separate root-level `tests` directory.
