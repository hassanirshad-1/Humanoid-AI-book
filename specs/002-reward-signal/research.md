# Research: Chapter 2 - Reward Signal

## 1. Objective
The purpose of this research phase was to identify any technical unknowns or decisions required to implement Chapter 2, as outlined in the feature specification.

## 2. Findings
The feature specification for "Chapter 2 - The Reward Signal" is comprehensive and builds directly upon the established technical stack and patterns from Chapter 1.

-   **Content**: The content will be authored in MDX and rendered using the existing Docusaurus frontend. No new technologies are needed.
-   **Code Examples**: The reward function examples will be written in Python, using `Numpy` for mathematical operations. This aligns with the existing codebase.
-   **Simulation**: The simulation environment will continue to be MuJoCo, consistent with Chapter 1.

## 3. Decisions

-   **Decision**: No new technologies or architectural changes are required. The implementation will proceed using the existing stack (Docusaurus, MDX, Python, Numpy, MuJoCo, Pytest).
-   **Rationale**: The current stack is sufficient to meet all functional and non-functional requirements of the feature. Maintaining consistency with previous chapters is prioritized to ensure a smooth learning experience for the reader.
-   **Alternatives Considered**: None were considered, as there was no compelling reason to deviate from the established project standards.
