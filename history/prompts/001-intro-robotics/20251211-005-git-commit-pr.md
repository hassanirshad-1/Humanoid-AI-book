Title: feat(chapter1): Initial setup and content for Chapter 1

Description:
This PR introduces the foundational setup for Chapter 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

Key Changes:
- **Docusaurus Frontend:** Initialized Docusaurus in the `frontend/` directory, configured for the textbook content.
- **Chapter 1 Content Integration:** Moved and configured all `.mdx` lessons for Chapter 1, ensuring they are displayed correctly.
- **Expanded Pedagogical Structure:** Updated Chapter 1 lessons to follow the "Expanded Concrete Sandwich" model, adding sections for analogies, code representations, and "gotchas" to enhance beginner learning.
- **Development Environment:** Configured Python linting (`flake8`), formatting (`black`), and testing (`pytest`) tools.
- **Architectural Decisions:** Documented key architectural decisions (Content Stack, Simulation Stack) via ADRs.
- **Framework Scripts:** Updated internal SpecKit PowerShell scripts to improve feature-specific command execution.

Files Affected:
- `frontend/` (new Docusaurus project and content)
- `specs/001-intro-robotics/plan.md`
- `specs/001-intro-robotics/data-model.md`
- `specs/001-intro-robotics/tasks.md`
- `history/adr/001-*.md`
- `history/adr/002-*.md`
- `history/prompts/001-intro-robotics/*.md` (PHRs)
- `.flake8`
- `.gitignore` (modified)
- `GEMINI.md` (updated)
- `.specify/scripts/powershell/*.ps1` (updated)

Related Issues: N/A

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: All changes related to Chapter 1 content, Docusaurus setup, and project configuration were successfully committed to a new feature branch and pushed to the remote repository. The URL for creating a Pull Request was provided to the user.
- 🧪 Tests: Python tests were not run by the agent as per user instruction, but formatting and linting checks passed. Docusaurus build was verified.
- 📁 Files: Numerous files were created, modified, and tracked as part of the commit, including the entire `frontend/` directory, updated `specs/` files, and new `history/` artifacts.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user should now create the Pull Request on GitHub.
- 🧠 Reflection: The commit message generation was robust, but issues with shell parsing multi-line commit messages required using a temporary file. The automatic identification of all modified/untracked files and staging them correctly was successful.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `git commit -m` command failed due to shell parsing of special characters within the multi-line commit message. This was resolved by using `git commit -F` with a temporary file.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Incorporate a utility function for `git commit -F` with temporary files to avoid shell parsing issues for complex commit messages.
