title: Generate Tasks for Refined Auth Plan
stage: tasks
date: 2025-12-20
feature: 007-auth-personalization

## Prompt

`/sp.tasks`

## Response snapshot

I have generated the implementation tasks for the refined `007-auth-personalization` feature.

- The detailed, actionable task list is available at `specs/007-auth-personalization/tasks.md`.
- **Total Tasks**: 38
- **User Story 1 (MVP)**: 8 tasks
- **User Story 2**: 7 tasks
- The tasks are broken down into phases, including setting up a new Node.js authentication service and modifying the Python backend and React frontend.
- The MVP will deliver a complete authentication flow and the ability for users to view personalized content.

The project is now ready for the implementation phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A comprehensive and actionable task list has been created, enabling developers to start implementation. The tasks are organized by user story to allow for incremental and parallel development.
- 📁 Files: `specs/007-auth-personalization/tasks.md` was created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now begin working on the tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation process was complex due to the dual-backend architecture. It required careful planning to create tasks for three separate parts of the system (Node.js backend, Python backend, frontend) and ensure they are correctly sequenced.
